## üëã About Me
Build & Release Engineer with a unique blend of technical expertise spanning animation, professional media software, and audio engineering. Currently working as a Pipeline Technical Artist/Build Engineer with Meta's Horizons team, developing AR/VR pipeline infrastructure and tools.

My 25+ year journey has taken me from designing recording studios and mixing for legendary drummer Clyde Stubblefield to optimizing build systems at Pixar Animation Studios (2016-2024), where I contributed to 11 major films including Coco, Soul, and Inside Out 2. At Pixar, I co-led the migration from RPM to Conda packaging, helped manage a repository of 530+ packages, and developed BuildMetrics‚Äîa Python application that reduced build times by 20% across the studio.

Currently, I'm developing my most ambitious project yet: **DevEnv**, a comprehensive cross-platform development environment system that automates the setup and management of development tools across Linux, macOS, Windows, and WSL. This modular system includes 15+ integrated modules covering everything from Python and Node.js to Docker and VSCode, with state-aware installation, backup capabilities, and container orchestration.

Now at Meta, I'm applying this expertise to cutting-edge AR/VR development, working with Perforce administration, building systems for 3D content pipelines, and developing APIs that support the next generation of social experiences in Augmented and Virtual Reality.

Before Pixar, I worked at Sony Creative Software/Sonic Foundry where I led Quality Assurance for Vegas Pro and designed and implemented installer systems (MSI, setup.exe) for their professional software suite. My roots in audio engineering give me a unique perspective on technical problem-solving, whether I'm optimizing build processes or designing sound systems.
