**Pipeline Technical Artist & Build Engineer** | **AR/VR Infrastructure Developer** | **Audio Engineer**

Born in Bogot√°, Colombia, and immigrated to the United States in 1985, I've built a unique 25+ year career that began with mixing sound for live bands and evolved into developing cutting-edge AR/VR pipeline infrastructure at Meta.

## üéµ The Journey: From Sound Boards to Build Systems

### **1990s: Sound Engineer (Teen/Young Adult)**
My technical journey started behind the mixing board at **The Chamber** and **The New Loft** in Madison, WI. As a teenager, I was mixing live sound for 100+ bands including legendary drummer **Clyde Stubblefield's Blue Mondays**, designing custom PA systems, and mentoring youth in audio engineering. This hands-on experience taught me precision, workflow optimization, and creative problem-solving under pressure.

### **1999-2005: QA Engineer at Sonic Foundry**
The transition from audio engineering to software happened naturally when I joined **Sonic Foundry** as Lead QA Engineer for **Vegas Video** (now MAGIX Vegas Pro). I was testing the very software tools that professional audio and video engineers used, bridging my understanding of user needs with technical implementation. This role taught me automated testing frameworks and the importance of user-centered design.

### **2003-2006: Studio Build & Production**
While at Sonic Foundry, I co-founded **23 Productions**, designing and building a complete recording studio with isolated vocal and drum rooms. This project combined my audio engineering roots with project management and technical architecture skills‚Äîessentially becoming a "build engineer" for physical spaces.

### **2005-2014: Install Engineer at Sony Creative Software**
At **Sony Creative Software**, I evolved into a Software Release Engineer, developing the installer systems that distributed Vegas Pro and other professional media software to millions of users. I created automated Windows installer platforms using Python MSI tooling, software update systems, and cross-platform registration frameworks. This is where I truly became a "build engineer" in the software sense.

### **2014-2016: Back to School**
When Sony laid me off in 2014, I turned the severance package into an opportunity to formalize my computer science knowledge at the **University of Wisconsin-Madison**. Working as a Research Assistant at the Center for High Throughput Computing while completing my coursework, I transformed what could have been a setback into a strategic investment in my technical foundation.

### **2016-2024: Pixar Animation Studios**
At **Pixar**, I supported 200+ developers and artists as a **Build Release Engineer**, contributing to 11 major films including *Coco*, *Soul*, and *Inside Out 2*. I co-led the migration from RPM to Conda packaging, managed a repository of 530+ packages, and developed **BuildMetrics**‚Äîa Python application that reduced build times by 20% across the studio.

### **2024-Present: Independent Developer & Open Source**
When Pixar laid me off in 2024, I saw an opportunity to pursue remote work that would allow me to move back to Madison and care for my aging mother. While searching for the right remote position, I channeled my decades of experience into ambitious open-source projects, creating tools that solve real-world development problems:

## üõ†Ô∏è Featured Projects

### **2025-Present: Meta (Horizons Team)**
Now I'm applying this entire journey to the cutting edge: developing **AR/VR pipeline infrastructure and tools** at Meta. Working with Perforce administration for large-scale 3D content, building systems for testing pipelines, and creating APIs that support the next generation of social experiences in Augmented and Virtual Reality.

## üîß Technical Evolution

**Audio Engineering Foundation**: Live sound mixing, studio design, signal flow  
**Software Quality**: Automated testing, user experience validation  
**Build Engineering**: MSI development, CI/CD infrastructure, cross-platform distribution  
**Pipeline Architecture**: SCons, Jenkins, Python applications, database-driven systems  
**Modern Development**: Container orchestration, AR/VR tools, developer experience

## üåü Philosophy

> *"A development environment should be a precise instrument, not a collection of accidents."*

From mixing boards to build systems, the core principle remains the same: create tools that empower others to do their best creative work. Whether it's helping a band sound their best on stage or helping developers ship great software, it's all about optimizing the creative process.
