- 👋 Hi, I’m Ivan, a Software Engineer focused on improving developer workflows and system efficiency. With over 25 years in software development, including work at Pixar Animation Studios and Sony Creative Software, I'm passionate about creating tools that make developers' lives easier.

## 🛠️ Current Code Focus
Building and sharing developer productivity tools, with emphasis on:
- Development environment automation
- System optimization
- Cross-platform infrastructure
- Configuration management
- Developer experience
Dusting old code off and modernizing it for github.

## 🔧 Tools & Projects
### DevEnv
Comprehensive development environment manager:
- Modular architecture for tool/service management
- Intelligent state tracking and backup systems
- Shell integration with custom aliases and functions
- Extensible JSON configuration system
- Support for Python, ZSH, Git, VSCode, Docker, and Conda environments

### BatAttack
A modern Phaser 3 platformer game where you play as a bat collecting fruits and coins while avoiding enemies. Originally developed as a school project for CS506 Software Engineering at UW Madison, this version has been modernized and restructured with improved architecture and level loading.

## 💡 Areas of Expertise
- System Architecture
- Full Stack Development
- Cross-Platform Development
- Python/C++ Development
- Developer Tooling
- CI/CD Infrastructure

## 🎥 Fun Fact
I have film credits in several Pixar movies including Toy Story 4, Soul, and Luca. When I'm not coding, you might find me working with audio/video production - I've designed recording studios and mixed live sound for many many bands!
